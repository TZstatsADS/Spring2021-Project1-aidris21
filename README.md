### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2021

+ Project title: **Do They Know?: A Brief Analysis of Accuracy of American Voters on Governmental Trivia Questions**
+ This project is conducted by Amir Idris

+ Project summary: In this analysis, we got hold of survey data conducted by the *American National Election Studies* data center. The surveys they conduct intend to capture how American citizens vote in each major election. But, rather than ask how they voted, today I'd like to know **who is voting**. More spceifically, I want to see how knowledgeable the voting public is on the machinations of the government they're electing. Does the knowledgeability differ across party lines or education?
